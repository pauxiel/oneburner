- i Developed this website using semantic markup. 
- I also used BEM naming convention for most of the class names. 
- No css library was used. i Used Sass, A css preprocessor. Therefore my css skill and sass skill were improved while building this project. 
- I achieved close to 90% of the correct visual of the first page in the mockup
